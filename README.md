# UCB-Tableau

In this project, I had to capture key metrics from a combined total of 17548339 rows of data from the New York Citi Bike Program. As such, I utilized python to aggregate and clean the data found from the Citi Bike Trip History Logs in order to create a data report for the most recent year (2018). Then, I used Tableau to create a number of visualizations that answered the following key questions:

- How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?
- How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
- What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months? 
- What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?
- Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?
- Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)
- Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)
- Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)
- Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?
- How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?
- How does the average trip duration change by age?
- What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?
- Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan? 
- How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

Additionally, city officials would like to see the following visualizations:
- A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
- A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena.

Lastly, as a chronic over-achiever:

- Find at least two unexpected phenomena in the data and provide a visualization and analysis to document their presence.
